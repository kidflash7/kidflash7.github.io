Primary Memory <p>

</font>

<font size=5 color=black>

Short-term data storage.  Stores the information your computer is actively
using so that it can be accessed quickly <p>

The CPU uses the RAM to store data needed for running the OS and all
programs stored on your computer's HDD <p>

I have 8 GB of DDR3 SDRAM on my computer <p>

Pro's:  Can access data fast as compared to secondary memory (HDD) <p>
Con's:  Not a lot of storage as compared to HDD.  It's volatile:  Data is lost when computer
is powered down <p>
