</font>
</center>
<font size="4" color=black>
<p>
You going to take a Cross Country Trip(USA) from East Coast to West Coast in any car of
your choice.  You are going to use Google Maps to plan your trip and get your data, 
you will use Google Sheets to record your data, and you will use Google Slides 
to graphically display trip.
<p>
First you need to find a car on the internet and look up the tank size and your MPG of your car.
<p>
Next you need to find a starting city any where on the East Coast, I started in Myrtle Beach, SC.
<p>
You will drive any where between 1.5 to 4.5 hours each day and then spend the night in each 
destination city, including start City and ending City.  You will only fill up your gas tank in
that city as well as eat dinner in that city.  The good thing about Google Maps is all that 
information is available.
<p>
Ok, let's get started:  Open up GMail and click on the Google Docs icon in the upper right corner
choose Google Maps.  

Once in Google Maps click on the directions icon in the upper left 
<img src = "images/dir.png"> <br>
type in starting city "Myrtle Beach, SC" <br>
next type in destination city "Charlotte, NC" <br>
now record the driving time in your spread sheet 3hr 17min needs to be converted to 3.28 hrs
also record your mileage 175 miles.  Remember one of the requirements is to only drive between
1.5 to 4.5 hours a day and you can only fill up for gas in your destination city.
<p>
Next you are going to use Google Slides to display your trip, get a screen shot of your 
map using the PRINT SCREEN key (Do not use your SMAT PHONE). Now open up paint and paste
your screen shot into paint, next use the select option and highlight only the map portion
of your trip and cut it. Open up new paint project and paste it in and save as "stage1.png".
Make a new folder on Google Drive to store this image in.
<p>
Now it's time to get gas: <br>
At the bottom left click on the Gas Icon <img src = "images/gas.png"> 
Pick a gas station and record the price in your spread sheet.
<p>
Now it's time to get a Hotel Motel Holiday Inn: <br>
At the bottom left click on the Hotel Icon <img src = "images/hot.png">
Find a Hotel and record name and price in your spread sheet.
<p>
Now it's time to seesight: <br>
Find some pictures of tourist attractions of the city and do a little 
research of the history of the city.
<p>
Now it's time to get dinner: <br>
At the bottom left click on the Restaurant Icon <img src = "images/din.png">
choose a Restaurant that has link to it's website so you can look up menu items
on their site <img src = "images/res.png">
go to their website choose items and record name of restaurant, what you ordered
and the total price of your meal in your spread sheet.
<p>
Now repeat this process until you end up on the West Coast.  Complete your spread sheet
and slide show.  In your slide show include map of route traveled, pictures of sites 
visited in your destination cities and some information about the city.  This
one is worth 30 points since you are doing 3 things: GMaps, GSlides, GSheets.
