You will submit an idea for a lab:
<p>
You will do a write up for a fun lab that you wish we had done in this class.
It doesn't need to be for Google Maps, but it can be.  The only requirement is, 
it needs to make use of the computer. You will also do the lab.
<p>
I thought a fun lab was lab 1 Google Maps.  I wrote the lab up in HTML and put it
in my webpage, but you can write it up in Google Docs.  I used Google Maps, Google Slides,
and Google Sheets to start my lab, please refer to Lab 1 Ex and Lab 2 Ex for partial 
examples of the lab

<p>
If it's really good I will include it in the curriculum.
