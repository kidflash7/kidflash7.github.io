You can get an hourly job or salary job in any city in the USA: 
<p>
You can go low end: Just graduated high school and you get a minimum wage job working at WalMart 
<br>
or
<br>
You can go high end:  Just graduated from UCLA with a degree in Computer Science and you get a salary job working at Raytheon.

<a href = "dream.htm" target="_blank">Dream Job: Do What You Love</a>


<p>
If you get a hourly job your hourly rate of pay
will be static ($10.25) and your monthly pay will be = hourly cell * hours worked per day(8) * days worked per week(5)
* weeks worked per month(4) 
<br>
If you get a salary job (engineer) then your yearly pay will be static ($120,000) and your monthly pay will be
= yearly cell / 12 and you won't have a hourly pay rate cell.  If you are an engineer living in LA you will have
more expenses and some of your expenses will be more(rent).

<font size=3 color=black>
You need to plan your meals for the week, you don't need a healthy diet but you do need a 

<a href = "diet.htm" target="_blank">balanced diet</a>. As my Grandma Applegate would say 
"Gotta Get your Greens"(and no it doesn't mean da same thang as "Makin' Scrilla")

Your salary from your job will determine your meals, that's why you have to get a job first and
research your salary.  If you are earning minimum wage you might be having oatmeal on
the other hand if your Makin' Scrilla then you might be having RibEye. Must have at least 3 
different dinners per week like my example. As my Grandma Applegate would say "Get to Gettin'"

<b>(3) <a href="raleys.htm" target="_blank">Let's go weekly grocery shopping</a></b>
</font>

<br>
<font size=3 color=black>

Based on your weekly grocery list you need to go shopping.
I shop at <a href = "https://www.raleys.com/" target="_blank">Raley's</a>
but you might choose WalMart cuz dat's where your Homies hang out.
The Grocery store you shop at depends on where your Job is(where you live).

<b>(4) <a href="grocery.htm" target="_blank">Monthly Grocery Budget Spreadsheet((2)SS-5Pts)</a></b>
</font>

<br>
<font size=3 color=black>
After you do your weekly grocery shopping, you will need to input the groceries, 
the unit cost, and the quantity into your Grocery SpreadSheet.  
You will also need to adjust the quantity to reflect a monthly spreadsheet.
I eat 1 bag of Granny Smith Apples (2 lbs) per week, so I will need to change
the quantity from 1 to 4 to reflect a monthly grocery spreadsheet.

</font>

<br>
<font size=3 color=black>
Your salary is gonna determine your budget. First you need to find a place to 
<a href="rental.htm" target="_blank"><b>RENT</b></a> and go from there...
<p>
I got a job at McDonalds in Yreka, I will be making Minimum Wage, so I have to Google
minimum wage in Yreka, CA(my example is outdated).  Since I'm making MW I got's to have 
a No Frills Budget: Rent(cheap) in Yreka, walk to work, staple food items, no DirecTv, 
maybe Netflix Streaming on my SP.  Don't forget to pay your federal and state taxes.
Use the tax tables below to compute taxes and remember fed and state tax
is based on what you earn, not on what you spend.  If you are working in another state
you will need to research how much state tax you will pay.
Your monthly income needs to exceed your monthly
expenditures. Include URL <a href="rental.htm" target="_blank">link</a> to the place 
you are going to rent at the bottom of your spreadsheet
