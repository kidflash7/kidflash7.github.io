Take a 3 minute typing test at "typing.com"

Final Part 2:

The link below shares an incomplete spreadsheet: "Final - Comp Skillz A".  
You need to fill in the missing(blank) parts with math calculations.  I shared it with you 
in CAN  VIEW ONLY mode so’s you’ll need to copy it and then paste it in a blank google sheet, 
and then fill in the missing blanks with math calculations.  Save it as, 'Your Last Name - Final P2', 
and email me the shared link, like you turned in all your assingments (labs) this year.
