Spread Sheets - Lab 1 - Purchase Order for Office Depot
</font>
</center>
<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
Make a Purchase Order form for ordering items from any store of your choosing.
<p>
<br>
Go online and look up at least 10 items from the store you chose and put 
Item Description and Unit Cost in your spreadsheet along with the Quantity.

<p>
<br>

Spread Sheets are dynamic, that means if I change the value in 
certain cells other cells with math calculations automatically
change, that's why you are using a spread sheet and not a doc.
<p>
Please refer to my Lab 1 Ex: <br>
All colored cells need to be dynamic(math calculations, i.e. <b>=F16*0.15</b>)
<br>
Same colored cells have <b>similar math calculations.</b>
<p>
Please refer to my Lab 1 Ex: #(number) <br>
Example 1:  I want cell F5 to be # in cell A5 times # in cell E5
so in <b>cell F5 I will type =A5*E5</b>.  The equal sign means it's a
math calculation. <br>
Example 2:  I want cell F16 to be the sum of all cells from 
F5 thru F15 so in <b>cell F16 I will type =F5+F6+F7+...+F15</b>.
