If you are not reading this then you probably have a Smart Phone, you already know
how to download Apps and how to figure out how they work.  If you can't figure 
out how an App works, you know how to look information up on the internet, and 
teach yourself how to use an App (computer program) ... just <b> Point n' Click </b>
<p>
Today's software has GUIs, CGIs, ICONs, EMOGEEs, basically you just,
<b> Point n' Click. </b> If you don't know how to use a program, you 
figure it out, you are Generation GUI; you grew up with computers,
you use computers for everything, u r fluent in Texican, you can type with 
your thumbs faster than most folks can type with all 20 digits.  You are smarter
than everyone else when it comes to computers, you are the generation of figuring 
it out, so's figure it out.

If you are still not reading this then you probably can type faster with your 
thumbs then with all your digits, you will need to demonstrate that you can 
type with all your digits, so the other part of this course is <b>Hunt n' Peck</b>

history use Google Slides, gather data for your math class use Google Forms
and do math stuff to that data use Google Sheets.
