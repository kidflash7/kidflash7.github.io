    How to Submit Assignments (Labs)
</center>
</font>
<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
Do not submit Assignments(Labs) for grading until you get an email from me 
saying "You can start turning in lab* *** it is due by 9/6/16".  The email 
will usually be sent on Monday to your school GMail Account i.e.
First Intial Last Name **@yuhsd.net, but you should check your email
daily, and the due date will be usually be that Friday.  The earlier
you turn it in the more possibility of extra credit and also a 
chance to fix any mistakes if it's not a 10 out of 10 or 20 out of 
20.  Check Aeries regularly to see if I graded your Lab and if I 
haven't graded it submit it following the instructions below: 
<p>

<b>All Google Doc Apps, except for email (GMail) and Forms: </b> <br>
<b>Way 1: </b>
Open the document you want graded, in the top right hand corner of the 
document click on the [Share] button in the Add people and groups 
Bar type in my GMail Address: (jalexander@yuhsd.net) 
keep Editor for Sheets change to 
Viewer for all other Google Doc Apps.  
<b>
Make sure "notify people" box is checked
</b>
then click the [Send] button

<p>

If I'm grading/helping a lab for the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th time and you 
click the share button and see that it's already shared with me, 
it doesn't send me an email with a link to that lab, even if you 
send me an email saying to grade it again, I'm not going to go 
hunting for that shared document, I could, but I won't.  
So if you are resharing it with me you have to start typing 
my email address again in the "Add people and groups" address bar.  
You will know you have done it right because you will see a 
"Notify People" statement and the box next to the "Notify People" 
needs to be checked.  It will then send me an email with a link to your lab:




<p>
<b>Way 2: </b>

Go into your Google Drive.  Right Click on assignment you wish to submit.
Choose "Share" Option, and in the Add people and groups Bar type in my 
GMail address: (jalexander@yuhsd.net) keep Editor for Sheets change to Viewer for 
all other Google Doc Apps.
<b>
Make sure "notify people" box is checked
</b>
then click the [Send] button



<p>

<b>Typing Labs: </b> <br>
Once you get an email from me saying:
"You can start turning in (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing lessons it is due by 9/14/16".
Then you can send me an email saying "Grade my (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing" or you
can come back to my computer and say "Can you please grade my (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing".
But before you do that make sure that you are done with all the Beginning typing lessons and you have
taken a <b>3 minute typing test</b>.

Once I receive that email from you I will go into "typing.com" and grade your progress.
<p>
Note: Make sure you take a 3:00 minute typing test. <br>
How:  Goto Typing.com homepage. In the menu at the top click on "Tests" link and choose
Take 3:00 Typing Test.
<p>


<b>GMails (Turn in both GMails together, forward Lab 1 followed directly by Lab 2): </b> <br>
When both emails are done (lab 1 and lab 2):  Open up email lab 1 go down to the 
Reply or Forward Box and choose Forward link, type in my email address:  "jalexander@yuhsd.net",
and hit the SEND button

followed directly by email lab 2.  It is imperative that I receive both forwarded emails within
seconds of each other, since they are worth 5 out of 5 together.

<p>

<b>Google Forms: </b> <br>
Open up your Google Form and in the upper right corner of your form you will see a
SEND button, click this button. In the blank line after the <b>To: </b> statement
type in my GMail address: jalexander@yuhsd.net  


<p>
<b>After I GRADE your lab and type the score in Aeries or give you HELP on your Lab I delete your email,  
if you want me to re-grade your Lab for more points or you need more help you must "Share"(or Forward)
the assignment with me again! via email.  Some students will need to do this many times to get
a good grade on their Lab. </b> 


<p>

<b>It is your job to check Aeries reguarly to make sure you don't have any missing
assignments, and if you do submit them via instructions above!  You will lose a point
for each day past the due date!  </b>
