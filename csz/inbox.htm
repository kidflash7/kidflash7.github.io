    How to Submit Assignments (Labs)
</center>
</font>
<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
Do not submit Assignments(Labs) for grading until you get an email from me 
saying "You can start turning in lab* *** it is due by 9/6/16".  The email 
will usually be sent on Monday to your school GMail Account i.e.
First Intial Last Name **@yuhsd.net, but you should check your email
daily, and the due date will be usually be that Friday.  The earlier
you turn it in the more possibility of extra credit and also a 
chance to fix any mistakes if it's not a 10 out of 10 or 20 out of 
20.  Check Aeries regularly to see if I graded your Lab and if I 
haven't graded it submit it following the instructions below: 
<p>

<b>All Google Doc Apps, except for email (GMail) and Forms: </b> <br>
<b>Way 1: </b>
Open the document you want graded, in the top right hand corner of the 
document click on the [Share] button in the People Box type in my GMail 
Address: (jalexander@yuhsd.net) keep Can Edit for Sheets change to Can 
View for all other Google Doc Apps.
<p>
<b>Way 2: </b>

Go into your Google Drive.  Right Click on assignment you wish to submit.
Choose "Share" Option, and in the People Box type in my GMail address:
(jalexander@yuhsd.net) keep Can edit for Sheets change to Can view for 
all other Google Doc Apps.
<p>

<b>Typing Labs: </b> <br>
Once you get an email from me saying:
"You can start turning in (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing lessons it is due by 9/14/16".
Then you can send me an email saying "Grade my (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing" or you
can come back to my computer and say "Can you please grade my (Beginning/Intermediate/Advanced) typing".
But before you do that make sure that you are done with all the Beginning typing lessons and you have
taken a <b>3 minute typing test</b>.

Once I receive that email from you I will go into "typing.com" and grade your progress.
<p>
Note: Make sure you take a 3:00 minute typing test. <br>
How:  Goto Typing.com homepage. In the menu at the top click on "Tests" link and choose
Take 3:00 Typing Test.
<p>


<b>GMails (Turn in both GMails together, forward Lab 1 followed directly by Lab 2): </b> <br>
When both emails are done (lab 1 and lab 2):  Open up email lab 1 go down to the 
Reply or Forward Box and choose Forward link and type in my email address:  "jalexander@yuhsd.net"
followed directly by email lab 2.  It is imperative that I receive both forwarded emails within
seconds of each other, since they are worth 5 out of 5 together.

<p>

<b>Google Forms: </b> <br>
Open up your Google Form and in the upper right corner of your form you will see a
SEND button, click this button. In the blank line after the <b>To: </b> statement
type in my GMail address: jalexander@yuhsd.net  


<p>
<b>After I GRADE your lab and type the score in Aeries or give you HELP on your Lab I delete your email,  
if you want me to re-grade your Lab for more points or you need more help you must "Share"(or Forward)
the assignment with me again! via email.  Some students will need to do this many times to get
a good grade on their Lab. </b> 


<p>

<b>It is your job to check Aeries reguarly to make sure you don't have any missing
assignments, and if you do submit them via instructions above!  You will lose a point
for each day past the due date!  </b>
