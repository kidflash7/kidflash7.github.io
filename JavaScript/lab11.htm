Lab 17:  PNZ Game
</font>

<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
<b>PNZ:</b> 
In the game of PNZ the computer generates a random number
consisting of 3 distinct digits ... (<b>ie</b> No digit is the same).
The user trys to guess the number and receives the following
hints from the computer: <br>
Each P means that a digit is in the correct position without
saying saying which position.  <br>
Each N means that a digit occurs in the number, but it's not
in the correct position. <br>
A single Z means no digits are in the number. <p>
    
Assume that the magic random number is 123: <br>

Lab 18:  Play BlackJack vs Computer
</font>

<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
<b>BlackJack aka 21: </b> 
Write the Code to play 21 against the computer.  The Computer will be the
Dealer and you will play against the computer (dealer).  Go on-line to
get all the information on how the game is played.  One of the 
hardest parts of the code is keeping track of which cards have 
been dealt, I would simplify things by making an infinite deck
Shoe.
<p>
Let's break this project down into smaller programs: <br>
Program 1:  Write the code to deal cards:  
</font>
<font size=5 color=red> [K&hearts;] </font> <font size=5 color=black> [7&spades;] </font>
<font size=4 color=black>
The user clicks a button and you deal a new card.
<p>
Program 2:  Add the code to Program 1 that will output the value of all the dealt cards.
The value of the card is the number on the card + Ace = 11 + Face Cards = 10.
<p>
Program 3:  Write the code to play BlackJack with the computer with only two cards being dealt
to you and dealer
<p>
Program 4: Now write the full code to play Blackjack against the computer(dealer).
<p>
<table>

<tr>
<td>

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways: 

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li> Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack"), without a dealer blackjack </li>
<li> Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 </li>
<li> or Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21 ("busted") </li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Note: Dealer and Player are dealt two cards. <br>
Note: Player (you) get's the opportunity to hit (get additional cards) up until you exceed 21 (bust, dealer wins). <br>
Note: An Ace is worth 11 unless your hand is over 21 then the Ace will turn to the value of 1. <br>
Note: Dealer has to hit until they reach 17, then they must stay. <br>
Note: Even score is a push (draw)<br>

Note: 
What is the <b>first thing young male teenages</b> say when
they take their first intro to programming class <p>
<b> "I wanna write computer games" </b> <p>
They don't know any Math, they don't know any Physics, but
they say <b> "I wanna write games" </b> Well here is a very 
simple game that requires no advanced Math and 
no Physics.  Notice I didn't say No Math, because all 
programming is is Math unless you CUT & PASTE someone elses
MATH homework. <p>
CUT n' PASTE <br>
