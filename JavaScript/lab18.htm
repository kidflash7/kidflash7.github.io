Lab 19: Approximate Pi by Finding Area Under The Curve
</font>
</center>
<font size='4' color='black'>
<p>
Approximate Pi by finding the area under the curve of the Unit Circle 
The equation of the Unit Circle is: x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1 
I would find the area of the circle in the 1<sup>st</sup> Quadrant and 
multiply by 4.  To approximate this area divide the region into n Trapezoids 
of equal width(1/n) and add them all up, the user will type in n. <br>

Lab 20: Approximate Roots of a 3<sup>rd</sup> Degree Poly
</font>

<p>
Approximate the root of a 3<sup>rd</sup> degree polynomial function that has 
real roots using the bisection method.  User will input coefficents(a, b, c, d) 
for the 3<sup>rd</sup> degree polynomial function:  ax<sup>3</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> +
cx + d = 0.
The user will also have to input two integers (m, n) such that they know a root 
and only one root exists between these two x-values.  I know a root exists between 
m and n if f(m)>0 and f(n)<0 or f(m)<0 and f(n)>0.  
Bisection Method:  Let's assume: n>m and f(m)<0 and f(n)>0 a good guess for the root 
is halfway between m and n:  mid1 = (m + n)/2  now if f(mid1)>0 you have a new n 
but if f(mid1)<0 then you have a new m now test to see if abs(m-n) < error 
if it isn't repeat this process until abs(m-n) < error then output f(m) or f(n) 
Note:  error is what you decide it to be in your program  i.e. error=0.0001 this will 
produce a root accurate to 3 places past the decimal.
