JavaScript:  Variables with Arithmetic & Assigment Operators
</center>

<p>
<font size="4" color=blue>
Lab 2: <p>
Declare 6 variables to store numbers(num1, num2, sum, prod, diff, div)  and 
3 variables to store strings(first, last, fullname).  Perform Arithmetic Operators 
on the two numbers and output your full name followed by the results of
arithmetic operations on the two numbers.

<p>

Becareful with Numbers!  Since you don't have to declare what type your 
variables are, sometimes the JavaScript Interpreter treats numbers as 
strings, which is fine unless you want to preform math calculations.  
To overcome this you might initially have to make use of the built
in function <b>Number(num1)</b> which forces variable num1 to be a number.
<p>
Becareful; you <b>CANNOT</b> use reserved words in JavaScript for Variable Names (i.e.
break, if, for, while, do, ...)

<b>It is very important to develope good habits when writing code: </b> <p>

<ul>
   <li> Plan before coding </li>
   <li> Write a very simple/basic version first and get it to work (debug) </li>
   <li> Use Indentation and blank lines for readability </li>
   <li> Divide program into the following ordered blocks of code </li>
   <ol>
       <li> Variable declarations </li>
       <li> Initialize variables </li>
       <li> Input </li>
       <li> Calculations </li>
       <li> Output </li>
   </ol>
   <li> Comment on what your code does (Internal Documentation) </li>
</ul>
