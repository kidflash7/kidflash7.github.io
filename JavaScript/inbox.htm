    How to submit JavaScript Labs for Grading

</font>
</center>

<p>
<font size="5" color=black>
Do not submit Labs for grading until you get an email from me saying
that it's due. You will get an email from me usually on Monday saying 
that Lab** is due by Friday (i.e. Lab3 Due on 9/1/17).  Anytime that week:
<p>
(1) If you and I are both in Room 25 at YHS, come back to my computer 
and I will bring your Lab up and I will grade it while you look on.
<p>
(2) If you're at home and working remotely send me a GMail and just drag your <b>lab4b.htm</b>
file into the body of your GMail message. 
<p>
NOTE:  If your page calls other pages or includes images,  then you will need to create a new
folder (i.e. lab7) that contains all the pages and images for that lab.  You will then need
to compress the folder into a zipped folder, to do this just right click the folder that 
contains all your pages and images for that lab (i.e. lab7) and choose 
<b>Send to > compressed(zipped) folder</b> send me a GMail and just drag your zipped
folder (i.e. lab7.zip) into the body of your GMail message.


<b> 

Always do (1) if we are both at school, that way if you have something structurally wrong with your JS, I 
can tell you what it is and you can fix it and resubmit for a higher grade. </b>
Your web page needs to work on the top browsers:  Chrome, Firefox, ME, and your
JS code needs to be structurally sound.  Just because it works and
looks good on your computer doesn't mean it's correct.  <b>It's imperative that
you save your labs in JavaScript subfolder in your My Documents folder
on the YHS Server</b>, so I can access it: 

<p>

file://yhs-fs/YHSUsers/Students/20/bbapplegate/JavaScript/

<p>

You need to check your School GMail Account daily, this is how I will 
communicate with you.  I will not come to you and say you are missing a 
Lab.  You need to stay on top of that yourself by checking Aeries and
your school GMail Account:  "FirstInitailLastName@yuhsd.net"
<p>
After I grade your lab and type the score in Aeries, I delete your email,
if you want me to re-grade your Lab for more points you must repeat the 
submit process all over again via email or coming back to my computer.
