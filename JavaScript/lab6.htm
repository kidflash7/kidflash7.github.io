Lab 6: <p>
Have user type in 5 numbers into an array.  <b>You</b> write the JS to find the Smallest, 
Largest, and the Mean.   <p>
    
<b>Hint:</b>  make sure your code works with 5 internal numbers before 
you ask the user to type in 5 numbers

<p>
<b>Hint:</b>  To find the smallest number in the array, first declare a variable called "small", set it equal to first array variable (i.e. small=arr1[0];)
Then loop through the rest of the array variables if any of them are smaller than var small then set var small equal to that array variable

Becareful with Numbers!  Since you don't have to declare what type your 
variables are, sometimes the JavaScript Interpreter treats numbers as 
strings, which is fine unless you want to preform math calculations.  
To overcome this you might initially have to make use of the built
in function <b>Number(num1)</b> which forces variable num1 to be a number.
