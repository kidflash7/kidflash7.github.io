Write the code that will create a Random Number between
1 and 100 inclusive and the user will try to guess this
number.  If the user doesn't guess correct you should 
say:  <b> Too Low Joe </b> or <b> Too High Guy</b>. 
The program will stop when they have guessed it
and give them a rating based upon how many guesses 
it took them <p>

Lab 11 - Stats

<p>
<font size="4" color=black>
<p>
Generate 20 Random Numbers: 1-100.  Find:  Mean, Median, and
Standard Deviation <p>
    
Note:  The hardest part of the program will be finding
the Median, because you will have to sort the numbers. <p>
    
Note:  One of the easiest sorting routines to understand 
is Selection Sort:  Let the first number in the Array (num[0]) be
the smallest, then loop through the rest of the numbers
and find the smallest number, then swap the two numbers
in the array. Repeat the process with the second number in 
the Array (num[1]) and keep repeating this process up until
the next to last number in the array. <p>


<ol>
  <li> Write code to loop through and find the smallest number in the array and it's location </li>
  <li> Write code to interchange 1st array element with smallest number in the array </li>
  <li> Now you are ready to write the complete sorting code </li>
</ol>

<p>
Note:  If you don't think searching and sorting routines are
important better ask <b> Google </b>  <p>
    
Note:  You might be asking what about Mode.  Mode is for little kids
or French people that want a scoope of ice cream on their pie <p>
