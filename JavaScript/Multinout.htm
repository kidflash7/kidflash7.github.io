     Multiple Data Input is best done in a HTML FORM.
     Multiple Data Output is best done in the HTML Webpage
     itself, with a call to a JavaScript Function making 
     the use of the doc.getElById("******").inHTML, 
     because the doc.write command will overwrite the page 
     and you won't see the input data that is in the form.

     You might think Pop-Up Windows (Prompt) to input data
     is Klever and Pop-Up windws to display data (Alert) 
     looks Kool but an efficient and effective webpage is 
     a page that gets the job done in the most stream line and
     simpliest way possible, No Bells, No Whistles!  

     Two things Amateurs need to learn and learn quick and 
     that is Programming (Coding) is MATH, Pre-Calculus with
     an A is a must to do any real coding, and let's face it
     getting an A in Pre-Calculus is a Cake Walk compared to 
     getting an A in the very 1st (REAL) programming course.
     You actually have to know how to use all the math that
     you learned in that class.  The second thing you need
     to learn is that the best code is the code that get's 
     the job done in the most plain and efficient way possible,
