<b>PNZ: </b> 
In the game of PNZ the computer generates a random number
consisting of 3 distinct digits ... (<b>ie</b> No digit is the same).
The user trys to guess the number and receives the following
hints from the computer: <br>
Each P means that a digit is in the correct position without
saying saying which position.  <br>
Each N means that a digit occurs in the number, but it's not
in the correct position. <br>
A single Z means no digits are in the number. <p>
    
Assume that the magic random number is 123: <br>

Note: 
What is the <b>first thing young male teenages</b> say when
they take their first intro to programming class <p>
<b> "I wanna write computer games" </b> <p>
They don't know any Math, they don't know any Physics, but
they say <b> "I wanna write games" </b> Well here is a very 
simple game that requires no advanced Math and 
no Physics.  Notice I didn't say No Math, because all 
programming is is Math unless you CUT & PASTE someone elses
MATH homework. <p>
CUT n' PASTE <br>
CUT n' PASTE <br>
CUT n' PASTE <br>

............ <br>
"I wanna play computer games" <br>
