<h1> This be my topic </h1>

<p class=class1> 
This is my first paragraph.
Text should be in blue with a size of 20 pixels, it should be in Trebuchet MS font
unless you don't have this on your PC then it should be in Georgia font then Arial font.
The font weight should be 500, 400 is normal.  The text should be centered inside a 
red double border
</p>

<div class=class2>
This is my second paragraph.
The &lt;div&gt; tag really doesn't do anything except group some text or images so that you can apply some formatting to all of them, this should have a border around it and center the
text so it looks like a newspaper or magazine article. The same with the &lt;span&gt; tag.
The &lt;div&gt; is usually used on a block of content while the &lt;span&gt; tag is 
usually used on one line, one word, one image, ...
</div>



<p class=class1 style="color: green; border-style: groove; border-color: blue;" >
This is my third paragraph.  I want it to have the same attributes as my first 
paragraph, except I want a different color, this is where I will put an in-line
style tag.  It will have all the attributes of the class, class1 but just change
the color as well as the border style and border color
</p>

<p> 
now this text is default font, color, size, because I didn't call or put any
CSS in the &lt;p&gt; tag.
</p>

<p class=class1 style="border-style: inset;" > 
<span style="font-weight: 900; color: black;">Assignment 1: (lab1.html) </span>

different classes use them inside the &lt;p&gt; tag to get different font, color, ...
for each paragraph.  Welcome to HTML5/CSS, good lunch and have fun.
