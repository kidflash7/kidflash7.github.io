How to submit HTML Labs for Grading 
</p>

<p class="ex2">
Do not submit Labs for grading until you get an email from me saying that it's due. You will get an email from me usually on Monday saying that Lab** is due by Friday (i.e. Lab3 Due on 9/1/17). Anytime that week:
<p>
(1) If you and I are both in Room 25 at YHS, come back to my computer 
and I will bring your Lab up and I will grade it while you look on.
<p>
(2) If you're at home and working remotely send me a GMail and just drag your <b>lab4b.htm</b>
file into the body of your GMail message. 
<p>
NOTE:  If your page calls other pages or includes images,  then you will need to create a new
folder (i.e. lab7) that contains all the pages and images for that lab.  You will then need
to compress the folder into a zipped folder, to do this just right click the folder that 
contains all your pages and images for that lab (i.e. lab7) and choose 
<b>Send to > compressed(zipped) folder</b> send me a GMail and just drag your zipped
folder (i.e. lab7.zip) into the body of your GMail message.


<b> 

Always do (1) if we are both at school, that way if you have something structurally wrong with your HTML, I can tell you what it is and you can fix it and resubmit for a higher grade. Your web page needs to work on the top browsers: Chrome, Firefox, ME, and your HTML code needs to be structurally sound. Just because it works and looks good on your computer doesn't mean it's correct. It's imperative that you save your labs in HTML5 subfolder in your My Documents folder on the YHS Server, so I can access it:  

<br>
<br>

file://yhs-fs/YHSUsers/Students/20/bbapplegate/HTML5

<br>
<br>

You need to check your School GMail Account daily, this is how I will communicate with you. I will not come to you and say you are missing a Lab. You need to stay on top of that yourself by checking Aeries and your school GMail Account: "FirstInitailLastName@yuhsd.net" 

After I grade your lab and type the score in Aeries, I delete your email, if you want me to re-grade your Lab for more points you must repeat the submit process all over again via email or coming back to my computer.
