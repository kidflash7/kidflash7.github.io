It's nice to have a way to get back to your original page, just make 
<a href="lab7.htm">a link back to your original page</a>.
This Tutorial is made using frames, so my links never have a back 
link because you can get to where you want by using the side 
navigational bar in the left frame and the new pages come up
in the right frame.
But if you don't use a navigation frame in your page always make 
a link back to your original page.

LAB 7:
</b>
<br>
Make a MAIN page that has a LIST of all your LABS 2-5.  Make your list
of labs link to that particular HTML lab.  Make one of the links a picture
or icon.  Make sure you include links back to your MAIN page in each of
your old labs.  I will grade all your old labs that I havn't graded yet
using this new page.
