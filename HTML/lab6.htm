Suppose you want to have a background image and you want to include
some text with your picture.  You put the background image in your
body tag, make sure you use a mild background image otherwise you'll
make your page hard to read.  I then put a picture of 
</font>
<font color=red size=4>
<b>COOL HAND LUKE </b> </font>
<font color=black size=3>
and adjusted the height
to take up 50% of the frame it's width will automatically adjust 
so's not to make the picture distorted, but you could of done the
width as well (instead of % you could of just used a # this will 
adjust the pictures size by pixels instead of %).  
I aligned the picture to the right so I can put text 
to the left of it.  You could also have aligned the picture to the 
left and put the text to the right of the image you do this in the 
img src tag with the align tag.Also in the img src tag is the hspace
and vspace, these put horizontal and vertical buffering in pixels 
around the picture, it's optional.  At any point in putting text 
to the left or right of the picture you can use the 
</font>
<b>
&lt br clear=left, right, or all &gt 
</b>
<font color=black size=3>
to stop text from flowing until no images to the left, right, or
until there is no images on either margin (all).  If you don't
use any of these the text will automatically start using the
whole screen when the picture and it's buffer that you set runs out.
HTML is pretty forgiving, it's not like programming so you should
experiment and play with it (This is only a basic tutorial).  So ... 
Taint Nothin'To it, but To Do It

You know what happened to LUKE in the movie, so you shouldn't smoke
cigs !!!

Make a page with a background image and also a regular image that 
takes up a % of the screen.  Align the image either to the 
left or right and write a paragraph or two of text to the side of the 
image.
