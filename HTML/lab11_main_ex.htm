This is just any old page that you have made in the past labs.
The key to getting it to appear in the the MAIN FRAME is done
in the FRAME PAGE ("Index.htm").

LAB 11:
</b>
<br>
Make a two frame page that has a MENU(NAV) FRAME and a MAIN FRAME.  <br>
Remember you need 3 Webpages: <br>
(1) A page to divide your page into 2 Frames "index.htm" <br>
(2) A navigation page (Menu) that has your links "nav.htm" <br> 
(3) A page you alread created "main.htm"  <br>
To bring up the two pages("nav.htm" & "main.htm") in the frames 
you must click on "index.htm". <br>
In your menu frame you should list links to all your labs except Lab6 & Lab7. 
Have it so that when they click on each lab link, it will bring up that lab in 
the main frame. Your MENU(NAV) FRAME can be to the: left, right, top, or bottom. 
<p>
Feel free to make updated pages that don't use Frames but have the same
function, with the use of HTML5 and CSS &lt!DOCTYPE HTML&gt ... I will use Frames
until they are no longer supported with the new browser's, because it's much easier
to make a menu that stay's the same.
