So what should your personal page be about?  Anythang you want as long it's school appropriate and
professional looking, but the more educational it is the better chance of getting a good score.  
What should your page look like?  You should have a website that shows off your knowledge of 
HTML 4: lots of pages and is easy to navigate.  I would suggest you make a 2 frame page and put
a navigational menu bar in one frame that has the links to all your pages and in the other frame
the pages will load.  This Final Project is worth 40 points, so I would have at least 10 links
in your navigational menu bar. Do you want to see an example, you've been using it.  This HTML
tutorial is an example of a website that has lots of pages and is easy to navigate:   
<a href="../ex1/index.html" target="_blank"> Freshman 2016 Example </a>
