<b>HyperText Markup Language</b> is used to create webpages.
 It is a Markup Language not a Programming Language that uses 
 <b> tags </b> e.g. <b>&ltbody&gt</b>.  Tags are reserved words 
 placed between less than and greater than signs that get 
 interpreted by the web browser to display your webpage.  
 Most tags need to be ended <b>&lt/body&gt</b>, everything that
 is between the start and end tag takes on the properties of 
 that tag.  The <b>&ltbr&gt</b> is one tag that doesn't need
 to be ended because it is a carriage return.  Since HTML isn't 
 a programming language it's pretty forgiving, that is if you 
 don't end a tag or you forget to put a tag in your page will 
 most likely be displayed.
 <p>
 You can use a HTML (webpage) Editor for convenience and to save
 time, but you gots to know how the tags work if you want to 
 add Script(Code aka Programming) inside your page.  Adding 
 JavaScript inside your webpage makes your page interactive.
 But before you learn JavaScript you gots to learn HTML.
