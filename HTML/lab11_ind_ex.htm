In your Index page you declare all your frames. This page has two frames
your menu button frame and the main frame. I made it like my Tutorial
into columns, 20% of the page is taken up by "nav.htm" and the rest of
the page is taken up by "main.htm".  You could of done it by rows and
you get a menu on top or the buttom like the blue menu bar.
<p>
You should call your Frame page "index.htm", because when you load 
your page on a server, by default your sever will load up "index.htm"
as your starting page.  All your Frame page does is bring up 2 webpages
in different parts of the screen.
