Now you want to make a page that consists of several HTM files, so 
we need to create links to the other HTM files that are part of your
big page.  Links are the topics you've been clicking on in the left
frame in this tutorial. You click on them and they bring up a new HTM
file in the right frame.  You can make anything on your page a link:
images, text, you name it.  First I'll show 
you how to make a part of your text a <a href="colors.htm">link</a>.
Notice that the link is underlined, this is automatic with text, that
way it'll stand out as a link even if the link is the same color as
the surrounding text.  I made it blue so it'll 
stand out as a link when you click it, it becomes yellow for an instant
and then when you come back to the page it is red.  This is done in the 
<b> body </b> tag with <b>link</b>, <b>alink</b>, <b>vlink</b>.  Ok I'll 
show you how it is done in the HTML that follows:
</font>
<hr size=3 width=85% direction=center color=black noshade>
<b>
&lt a href="url_address" &gt
<font color=black size=3>
<a href="gumby.htm"> the text you want clickable </a>
</font>
&lt /a &gt
</b>

<hr size=3 width=85% direction=center color=black noshade>
<font color=black size=3>
The <b>"url_address"</b> is where the new page is located and the name 
of the page.  
<b>A local link (link to the same web site) is specified with a relative 
URL (without http://www....). </b> My new page is in the same directory so I 
just called the name of the HTM file I want to come up when they click
on the link.  But suppose I want to call on a page <b>"colors.htm"</b> that 
is in a folder called <b>"files"</b> I would access it by the following 
local "url_address" <b>"files/colors.htm"</b>.  Now let's make an image a link...
</font>

<hr size=3 width=85% direction=center color=black noshade>
<a href="clint.htm">
<img src="images/clint5.jpg" height=30% align=left>
</a>
<b>
&lt a href="new_page.htm" &gt <br>
&lt img src="image_name.jpg"  &gt <br>
&lt /a &gt <br>
&lt /body &gt <br>
&lt /html &gt <br>
</b>
<br clear=all> 
<p>
<font color=black size=3>
