The three most common kinds of images used in webpages are: <br>
1)  *.JPG format which are used for pictures <br>
2)  *.GIF format which are banners, logo's, and art stuff <br>
3)  *.PNG format which is like GIFs, but parts of the image can be transparent <br>

The following will put The Red River War Logo on the screen "hate_texas.gif"
and below it a picture of The Boz "the_boz.jpg", both of these images
are located in the folder "images".  I also centered both the logo and picture

Make a subfolder (images) in the folder you created in My Documents (HTML).
This is where you should store all your images that you will use in your 
future pages. Go on the internet to get some images you wish to use in 
your page or you could use your own.
<p> 
Make a page with an image in it and write a paragraph about the image.
Your image should be a JPG, a GIF, or PNG.  Center the image in your page
and put a HEADING above it.  Write your paragraph below the image.
