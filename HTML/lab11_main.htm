I created this tutorial using frames, it makes it easier to use this 
tutorial. The pro to using frames, is the ease in navigating the page. 
The con is everybody's computer display is different so you get those 
scroll bars all over the place, which looks amateur. But a two frame 
page is an easy way to present a lot of info so the user can 
get around like <b>Kid Flash</b>, Baby.  Most of the professional 
looking pages look like they use frames but they don't that way they 
avoid scroll bars.
<p>
This page has a menu frame to the left and a main frame to the right.  
My menu frame has all the links and doesn't change and my main frame 
brings up all the tutorial pages you've been using.  
<p>
I've also created frames within frames to illustrate the 3 parts to 
making a simple frame.  The 3 parts to create a simple frame:  
Index Page, Main Frame, Menu Frame, are written in 3 seperate files.  
The Index page is the page you start with, it's where you declare all 
the frames of your page and that's it.  A simple frame page has only 
two frames a Menu frame, this is your menu, and a Main frame this is 
where the pages jump up when you click on the menu buttons.  You can 
have more than 2 frames, but not advised.
<p>
Now just click on the blue menu on the bottom to find out how to make
the INDEX which makes your page into 2 frames and how to make the 2
pages that will appear in the 2 frames: MENU FRAME, and MAIN FRAME.....
