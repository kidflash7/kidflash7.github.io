Difference between Backslash(\) and Forward Slash(/)

The "backslash" is one of the most incorrectly used terms in computing. 

People often refer to forward slashes as backslashes, especially when referring to URLs. 

Web addresses (URLs), such as 

http://198.189.71.12/yhsmath/index.htm 

contain forward slashes, rather than backslashes. 



The difference between a backslash and a forward slash is that a 

backslash leans backwards ( \ ), while a forward slash leans forward ( / ).

In Windows, backslashes are used to separate directories in file paths 

(ex: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Billy Bob\). On Mac and Unix systems, forward slashes are used for the same 

purpose (ex: /System/Library/BillyBob).

Forward slashes can also be called simply "slashes," since they are much more commonly used than backslashes. 

(Slashes are also used as division symbols and in place of the word "or.") Therefore, the 

URL http://YHS.net/helpcenter/ could be verbalized, "YHS dot net slash help center." 

<p>

When posting your page on a server, even a Windows based server you need to use the Forward Slash (/) when
working with file paths in directories i.e. </font>
