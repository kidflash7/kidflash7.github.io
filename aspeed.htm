Final - Take the infomation presented in this page and create a page that displays it in a table: <br>
Row1 Name of the Picture/Animal (i.e. Kangaroo) <br>
Row2 Thumbnail of that Picture <br>
Row3 Weight of that animal <br>
Row4 Top Speed of that animal<p>

Have a heading for the table and have both the heading and table centered
on the page.  Make the thumbnail of the cheetah a link so that when they 
click on it it brings up  a new page with the cheetah picture centered on the
page and the height of the picture takes up 50% of the page.  Have the word
"Cheetah" in large font right above the picture and weight and speed below
the picutre.  Make sure that you email me the link to where this page is so I can grade it. <br>
