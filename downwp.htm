<b> The easy way! and the Google Chromebook Way </b>
<p>

Old school computer nerds carried around floppy disks to store their programs on. 

The floppy disk got replaced by USB flash drives they look like this:

<br>

<img src="images/fdrive.jpg">

<br>

They cost about $10 and go up from there. 

The more storage capacity the greater the price, my folder(yhsWP) that has 

all the subfolders to the Los Mineros Page is about 200 MB, easily fits on smallest 

capacity flash drive.  Open up Microsoft Edge(Google Chrome will not do) and copy 

this in the URL while connected to a wired LAN connection on the YHS campus:

<p>

<b> file://yhs-fs/Apps/Users/bba </b>

<p>

copy the yhsWP file to your flash drive.  Plug it into your USB Port HomeComputer/ChromeBook.  

Open up the yhsWP folder scroll down and open the “index” file and as the French say “Voila, Los Mineros”

 
<p>



<b>Do the following at school over the YHS LAN:</b>
<p>
Type in the following in Microsoft Edge Browser's URL:  <b> file://yhs-fs/Apps/Users/bba </b> 
<p>
It will bring up a folder showing the <b>yhsWP</b> folder.  Sign into Google Drive, drag the 
<br>
<b>yhsWP</b> folder into your Google Drive.


<p>
<b>Do the following on your home computer on WWW (Way 2):</b>
<p>
Sign into Google Drive, right click the yhsWP folder and choose download.  It will downlaod the folder
as a zipped folder.
<br>
After download is complete go into your download folder and right click on your 
<br>
<b> yhsWP - 20200113T184643Z-001 </b> zip folder and choose > 7-Zip 
(you have to download this free program if you don't have it) 
<br>
next choose  > Extract Files and Choose where on your computer you wish to extract:
<p>
<b> C:\Users\BillyBob\Downloads </b>
<p>
Open up your extracted folder <b> yhsWP - 20200113T184643Z-001 </b> and <b> yhsWP </b>
folder and then <b>index</b> file and it will open up my Los Mineros Page.



<p>
<b>Do the following on your home computer on WWW (Way 3):</b>
<p>

Click on the shareable link:

<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9_WrYLuSbOBc0h3a05KWXRhdkE" target="_blank"> shareable link </a>

<p>

It will open up shared file in your Google Drive, at the top it will have:  <b> Shared with me > yhsWP </b>
